### Composite
> is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

> Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.

> For example, imagine that you have two types of objects: Products and Boxes. A Box can contain several Products as well as a number of smaller Boxes. These little Boxes can also hold some Products or even smaller Boxes, and so on.
